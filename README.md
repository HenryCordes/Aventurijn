Aventurijn.Activities.Web, a webapplication to register the activities that children participate in during their day at school.
Because the way the school facilitates learning, 'just in time learning' there is a need to register the activities per child.

That is the starting point for this application.
Which will be written in C#, leveraging ASP.NET MVC 4 with a SQL Server backend.
